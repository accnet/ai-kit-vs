# AI-Kit

**Name:** ai-kit **Version:** 1.0.0

This is the canonical entry point for every coding agent working in this
repository. Read it before planning, editing, reviewing, or releasing work.

## Source Of Truth

AI-Kit is the source of truth for its architecture, paths, and contracts.
The earlier kit has been retired; its reusable guidance was adapted into this
kit and the migration record is kept in `.ai/memory/migration-v1.md`.

Keep these core contracts stable:

- `.ai/agents/<role>/` is a six-document role contract: `role.md`, `input.md`,
  `rules.md`, `prompt.md`, `checklist.md`, and `output.md`.
- `.ai/skills/<domain>/<technology>/` is curated technology knowledge with
  `overview.md`, `patterns.md`, `best-practices.md`, `pitfalls.md`, and
  `examples.md`.
- `.ai/workflows/<intent>/workflow.md` defines the delivery path.
- `.ai-work/` holds disposable work state, plans, tasks, reports, and logs.

Agents and Skills are first-class and permanent. Capability manifests
(`.ai/capabilities/<id>.json`) only *reference and package* them — they never
move or replace `.ai/agents` or `.ai/skills`.

Never rename, flatten, or replace these contracts as part of importing an idea
from the earlier kit. Adapt the idea to the current contract instead.

## Tool Compatibility

`AGENTS.md` is the only normative instruction source. Tool-specific files are
thin entry points and must not duplicate or override these rules:

- GitHub: `.github/workflows/gates.yml` runs portable validation in CI.
- GitHub Copilot: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` directs Copilot here.
- Cursor: `.cursor/rules/ai-kit.mdc` applies this file to every workspace task.
- Gemini CLI: `GEMINI.md` directs Gemini here.
- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/commands/` direct Claude here.

All tools use the same control plane, local skills, state schema, and gates.
Do not introduce host-only skill paths, tool-specific state, or conflicting
task formats. Git hooks are defense in depth; CI and this file remain canonical.

## Scope And Quality

Build the kit by useful capabilities, not by target file count. A document,
template, agent, or skill is complete only when it provides actionable rules,
clear inputs and outputs, and a way to verify its use. Do not create skeletons,
empty placeholders, duplicate prompts, or generic content that cannot guide a
real task.

AI-Kit is an executable multi-agent workflow engine for
controlled delivery of large projects in Codex and VS Code. It is not complete
until the orchestration components below have executable interfaces, durable
state transitions, and automated tests. Do not describe a prompt convention as
an engine capability without this evidence.

Prefer the smallest change that makes one capability reliably usable. Add a
new agent, skill, workflow, or automation only when it has a concrete owner,
trigger, interface, and verification path.

## Workflow Engine Architecture

The engine coordinates work through these components. Their contracts are
separate but share one canonical task and phase state model.

- **Planner:** turns a request into a roadmap, executable plan, tasks, phases,
  dependencies, risks, and acceptance criteria.
- **Scheduler:** validates the task dependency graph as a DAG, identifies
  runnable tasks, and opens a phase only when its dependencies are complete.
- **Agent Router:** chooses an eligible role, loads its role contract, scoped
  skills, and minimal context, and records why that assignment was made.
- **Executor:** performs an assigned phase, captures commands, changes,
  evidence, and handoff data without claiming review or QA authority.
- **Reviewer:** independently evaluates scope, contracts, coding standards,
  security, regressions, and residual risk.
- **QA:** verifies acceptance criteria through reproducible tests and reports
  failures back to the task state.
- **State Manager:** owns legal task and phase lifecycle transitions, claims,
  attempts, blocking reasons, and append-only execution history.
- **Context Engine:** ranks and loads the smallest relevant source, workflow,
  skill, decision, and test context for a specific assignment.
- **Memory Engine:** records durable architecture decisions, conventions, and
  postmortems separately from disposable session state.

The Scheduler, State Manager, and Agent Router are the control plane. They
must be deterministic for the same declared state and must reject invalid DAGs,
illegal transitions, missing acceptance criteria, and ambiguous task ownership.
The Planner, Executor, Reviewer, and QA are workers operating through that
control plane; no worker may bypass a gate by directly changing lifecycle state.

No silent completion: a task is NEVER complete just because code compiles. You
MUST submit through `ai-kit agent result` before reporting implementation work
as done; QA, independent review, and gate closure still have to pass.

### Required Runtime Evidence

Before a component is marked implemented, provide:

- A documented input/output contract and error behavior.
- A persisted schema or explicitly versioned state format.
- Tests for normal, blocked, invalid, and recovery paths.
- An observable audit record explaining decisions and transitions.
- Compatibility with the stable directory contracts above.

## Startup Procedure

1. Read `.ai/kit.yaml`, `.ai/rules.yaml`, and `.ai/registry.yaml`.
2. Read `.ai-work/state/current.json`. Resume only a current, scoped task.
3. Classify the request: feature, bugfix, refactor, migration, release, or
   research. Select its workflow and applicable role contract.
4. Load only the local technology knowledge needed for the task using
   `bash .ai/scripts/skills-for.sh <role>`.
5. Inspect relevant project files and tests. Existing project conventions take
   precedence over generic kit guidance.
6. Create or update `.ai-work/tasks/tasks.md` before implementation, unless
   the user explicitly waives G1 for this specific trivial documentation-only
   change.
7. For a new idea, use `bash .ai/scripts/ai-kit.sh plan --idea ... --owner
   <role> --acceptance ...`; review its explicit assumptions before execution.
8. Execute within the declared scope, verify the acceptance criteria, record
   QA and review evidence paths, and obtain review before delivery.

## Skill And Concern Routing

Use `route T<n>` as the authoritative runtime assignment. It returns the role
contract, core skill entry points, stack-relevant technology knowledge, and
minimal context. `skills-for.sh <role>` is the equivalent discovery command
before a task exists. Read the returned `SKILL.md` or `overview.md`; do not
load unrelated skill directories speculatively.

These concerns are mandatory when their trigger is present:

| Trigger | Required role and core skills |
| --- | --- |
| Auth, untrusted input, sensitive data, permissions | Security: `security-review`, `threat-modeling` |
| External API, webhook, event consumer, retry | Integration: `integration-contracts`, `webhooks-and-retries` |
| Latency, memory, throughput, query volume | Performance: `performance-profiling`, `observability` |
| Parallel tasks, blocked work, handoff, retry | Scheduler/Router: `workflow-orchestration` |
| User journey or public API/event boundary | QA: `e2e-testing`, `contract-testing` |
| Cross-cutting choice or durable trade-off | Architect: `architecture-decisions` |
| Ship, CI, version, deployment, rollback | Release/DevOps: `release-management`, `github-actions-ci`, `deployment-infra` |
| UI interaction | Frontend: `accessibility`, `frontend-core` |
| New or upgraded dependency | DevOps: `dependency-management` |
| User, API, operational, or decision documentation | Document: `documentation-maintenance` |

## Planning And Execution

Every non-trivial task record must state:

- Goal, scope, exclusions, risks, and open questions.
- Atomic tasks with owner, affected paths, dependencies, and observable
  acceptance criteria.
- Verification commands or other objective evidence.
- Review outcome and residual risk.

For a new idea, `plan` creates these initial artifacts:

- `.ai-work/roadmap/roadmap.md`
- `.ai-work/plan/plan.md`
- `.ai-work/tasks/tasks.md`
- `.ai-work/workflows/<workflow-id>/state/workflow.json` as the canonical lifecycle state

Work in dependency order. Parallel work must have disjoint file ownership or
an explicit integration owner. Re-plan when scope changes; do not silently
extend a task. Migration and database work always requires a plan, including
schema changes, data fixes, seeds, and backfills.

## Gates

- **G1 - Plan:** before implementation, `.ai-work/tasks/tasks.md` has coherent,
  verifiable acceptance criteria. Database or migration work never uses a
  trivial fast path.
- **G2 - Task completion:** every acceptance criterion has evidence and the
  relevant configured checks pass before marking a task done. `qa-pass` and
  `review-approve` require at least one existing `--evidence` path.
- **G3 - Review:** a reviewer records `approve` with no unresolved blockers
  before delivery.
- **G4 - Hygiene:** never commit secrets, credentials, or transient
  `.ai-work/` state. Keep changes traceable to a task.
- **G5 - Destructive operations:** require explicit user approval for the
  specific operation, including destructive data changes, force pushes, and
  production deployment.

When a gate fails, leave the task open and record the failure. Do not hide
retries or mark partial work complete.

## Role Boundaries

- Planner defines executable work and acceptance criteria; it does not invent
  requirements or implement unrelated code.
- Researcher gathers evidence and identifies unknowns; it does not silently
  convert assumptions into requirements.
- Implementers follow the assigned agent contract and existing project style.
- QA validates observable behavior and records reproducible failures.
- Reviewer looks for functional regressions, contract breaks, security issues,
  missing tests, and scope drift. Review is independent of implementation.
- Release checks verification evidence, compatibility, rollback information,
  and deployment approval.
- Security assesses threats and trust boundaries before allowing sensitive
  changes through review.
- Integration owns external contracts, webhook verification, retry safety, and
  failure behavior.
- Performance works from measured baselines and budgets, never intuition.
- Document keeps authoritative user, API, operational, and decision artifacts
  synchronized with delivered behavior.

## Context And Memory

Start from the owned task and nearby source. Load the smallest useful context:
the selected workflow, role contract, relevant skills, code, and tests. Keep
session-specific notes in `.ai-work/`. Promote durable conventions or decisions
only to the appropriate committed documentation, never by treating
`.ai-work/` as permanent truth.

## Change Discipline

- Preserve user changes and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Use project-local references under `.ai/`; do not depend on host-specific
  agent skills to define repository behavior.
- Do not claim an action, test, or runtime capability exists without evidence.
- Record architecture decisions and durable lessons in `.ai-memory/`; keep
  task-specific evidence and reports in `.ai-work/`.
- Escalate unclear requirements, conflicting contracts, security-sensitive
  scope, or missing authority before taking irreversible action.

## Verification Commands

Run the local checks appropriate to the change:

```bash
npm test
bash .ai/scripts/check-skills.sh
bash .ai/scripts/check-kit.sh
bash .ai/scripts/check-gates.sh all
```

Run `bash .ai/scripts/doctor.sh` after installing the kit or changing its
configuration. CI runs the same portable checks on GitHub.

## Runtime Capabilities (1.0)

The control plane exposes these commands through the global `ai-kit` launcher
when used from a consuming project (state commands accept `--state <path>`):

- Workflow: `init`, `plan`, `workflow-create`, `workflows`, `add-task`, `bind`, `ready`,
  `transition`, `validate`, `show`, `status`, `timeline`, `blocked`, `graph`,
  `route`, `onboard`.
- Capabilities: `capabilities [id] [--kind knowledge|framework|language|tool]`
  lists or resolves capability manifests over Agents and Skills.
- Reproducibility: `lock` writes the device lock in `.ai/ai-kit.lock.json` from
  the kit root, or `.ai-kit.project.lock.json` from a consuming project;
  `verify-lock` checks both when the project lock exists. It pins process and
  configuration, not model output.
- Global home: `home [--init]` manages the shared `~/ai-kit/` runtime
  (`AIKIT_HOME` override). Project plugins shadow global ones.
- CLI help: every command accepts `--help` and `-h`; help exits before validation
  or side effects.
- Providers run through the CLI provider adapter
  (`.ai/engine/provider-adapter.md`), and only executables allowlisted in
  `.ai/security.yaml` may launch.
- Verification commands from project config are parsed as argv, checked against
  the same executable allowlist, and run without a shell.

Automation entry points (global launchers):

- `ai-kit-worker <start|stop|list|status>` manages provider workers
  (`start --workflow-id ID [--role executor|qa|reviewer|planner] [--plugin ID]`).
- `ai-kit-gate <workflow-id> [--once]` runs every configured verification check
  by default and closes tasks only after a reviewer plugin has approved them.
  `--skip-verify` is an explicit local bypass; `--roles review` is rejected
  because review must be submitted through `ai-kit agent review`.
- Planning tasks without verification commands are QA-passable; implementation
  tasks remain fail-closed until project verification is configured. Editor
  claims default to a 900-second lease and accept `--lease-seconds <n>` or
  `AIKIT_LEASE_SECONDS`; long-running clients should heartbeat periodically.

The VS Code extension in `extension/` is a thin UI client that shells out to
these commands (read-only views plus start-worker / run-gates controls) and holds
no AI logic.
